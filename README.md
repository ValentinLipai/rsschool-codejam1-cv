### ABOUT ME:
Since childhood, I have been interested in technology, computers and information technology. In 2014, I graduated from university with a degree in economics.

In the fall of 2016, I became interested in developing web sites, I really liked it, and I began to learn HTML and CSS, combining with work. A year later, I got a job at a webstudio in Minsk, at the position of the HTML-coder.
